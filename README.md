# VETRIS: ViscoElastic Tissue-Robot Interaction Simulation with Material Point Method

**VETRIS** is a physics engine designed to simulate **viscoelastic soft tissue interactions with robotic systems** using the **Material Point Method (MPM)**. It focuses on capturing realistic tissue dynamics, viscoelastic deformation, and two-way coupling between soft and rigid bodies, enabling research in **soft robotics, biomechanics, and contact-aware manipulation**.

## **Abstract**

Robotic manipulation of soft biological tissues requires accurate modeling of complex viscoelastic behavior, non-linear deformations, and robust contact dynamics. **VETRIS** addresses these challenges by combining the Material Point Method (MPM) with advanced viscoelastic constitutive models to simulate tissue deformation under robotic interaction.

The engine includes:
- **Two-way coupling between rigid robots and viscoelastic tissues**.
- **Contact modeling with friction and rolling dynamics** for tool-tissue interaction.
- **Stable implicit time-stepping** to handle large deformations and high stiffness.
- **Modular design for constitutive models** (Neo-Hookean, Kelvin‚ÄìVoigt, and extended viscoelastic laws).

## **Key Features**

- **Material Point Method Core**
  - 3D MPM solver with PIC/FLIP-style particle-grid transfer.
  - Support for both elastic and viscoelastic materials.

- **Robot-Tissue Interaction**
  - Two-way force exchange between a robotic manipulator (rigid) and deformable tissues.
  - Collision detection and frictional contact modeling.

- **Viscoelastic Tissue Models**
  - Neo-Hookean + damping-based viscoelasticity.
  - Extendable to elasto-plasticity and continuum damage models.

- **Rendering**
  - Real-time visualization using **PyRender** + **Trimesh**.
  - Particle-to-mesh reconstruction (convex hull or marching cubes).

- **Research-Focused**
  - Designed for robotic contact studies, surgical simulation, and bio-robotics research.
